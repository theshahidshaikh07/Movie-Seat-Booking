# Movie-Seat-Booking
This movie seat booking system offers a user-friendly interface to select and visualize available seats for a movie show. It demonstrates dynamic seat selection and booking features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Note that the current implementation manages seat availability during the session and resets upon page refresh, making it ideal as a learning project or prototype for booking interfaces.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
